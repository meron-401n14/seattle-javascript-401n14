# LAB: Node Ecosystem

Time to get hands on with Test Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration (CI). For this lab, you will be writing a fully tested validation module and shepherd it through a CI pipeline.

## Before you begin
Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

#### Getting Started
In the `starter_code` folder, there is a partial implementation of a "validator" module

In the `root` of that folder, you'll find a file called `index.js` that wires in the validator module and attempts to run functions imported from it.

In the `__tests__` folder, you'll find a file called `validator.test.js` that wires in the validator module, sets up some testing (optimistically) but contains no test code

## Requirements

### Developer Implementation
**USE TDD Practices**

Write an object validation module that exports a "validate" method that can, based on the inputs, validate whether or not an entity is satisfactory. 

Things we want to be able to validate

* Is the entity itself the right type (array, object, function etc)
* All all "required" properties present and do they have values?
* For any property that specifies a type, does the value match that type?

#### Testing
*Validation Module* 
* Test each method for proper/improper use (required params)
* Validate that validation is reliable
* Validate proper error conditions/returns

***Software Engineering Note!***
*Externalizing type checking and argument validation is a good exercise in refactoring code*

---

### End User Implementation
* Use the `index.js` file to validate objects using the imported functions from the module
* `console.log()` the return values
