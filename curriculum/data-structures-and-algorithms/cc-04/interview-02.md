# Interview 02

Generate the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number, 2 different ways.

## Interviewer Specifications

- Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Act as an interviewer, giving a candidate a code challenge
- Score the candidate according to the [Whiteboard Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scthkmARfzAFZrSYAp6LA2coOaoWUWbSzMbtIU4jcHw)
- You are free to offer suggestions or guidance (and see how they respond), but don't solve it for the candidate

## Feature Tasks

- As an interviewer, familiarize yourself with the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html)
- Ask the candidate to write a function to accepts an integer, and returns the n<sup>th</sup> number in the Fibonacci sequence.
- You should be able to check their work for small values of n: if `fib(n)` is equal to `fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`.
- Encourage the candidate to work quickly towards a first solution, that is either recursive or iterative (with a `while` or `for` loop)
- Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.

## Structure

Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview.

Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available.

Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to at least convince you that their code works to solve the problem.

Assign points for each item on the rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill.

Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page.

## Example

| Input | Output       |
| ----- | ------------ |
| `0`   | `0`          |
| `1`   | `1`          |
| `2`   | `1`          |
| `3`   | `2`          |
| `4`   | `3`          |
| `5`   | `5`          |
| `6`   | `8`          |
| `7`   | `13`         |
| `8`   | `21`         |
| `...` | `...`        |
| `14`  | `377`        |
| `...` | `...`        |
| `45`  | `1134903170` |
| `...` | `...`        |
