# Code Challenge

Breadth-first Traversal.

## Specifications
- Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a public repository called `data-structures-and-algorithms`, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md.
- Create a new branch in your repo called `breadth-first`.
- Your top-level readme should contain a "Table of Contents" navigation to all of your challenges and implementations so far. (Don't forget to update it!)
- This assignment should be completed within the `challenges` subdirectory of the repository.
- On your branch, create...
    - _C#_: Extend your `BinaryTree` class according to the feature tasks below 
    - _JavaScript_: Extend your `BinaryTree` class according to the feature tasks below
    - _Python_: Extend your `BinaryTree` class according to the feature tasks below
    - _Java_: Extend your `BinaryTree` class according to the feature tasks below
- Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
    - _NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository._

## Feature Tasks
- Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited node's value.
