# Lab 10: Stacks and Queues

### Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure

## Specifications
- Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called `data-structures-and-algorithms`, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- Create a branch in your repository called `stack-and-queue`
- On your branch, create...
    - _C#_: Create a new console app named `StacksAndQueues`.
    - _JavaScript_: a folder named `stacksAndQueues` which contains a file called `stacks-and-queues.js`
    - _Python_: a folder named `stacks_and_queues` which contains a file called `stacks_and_queues.py`
    - _Java_: a package named `stacksandqueues` which contains files called `Stack.java`, `Queue.java`, and `Node.java`.
- Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
    - _NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository._

## Features
- Create a `Node` class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
- Create a `Stack` class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
    - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to `top` when the stack is created.
    - Define a method called `push` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the `top` of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
    - Define a method called `pop` that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node's value.
    - Define a method called `peek` that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.

- Create a `Queue` class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
    - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to `front` when the queue is created.
    - Define a method called `enqueue` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
    - Define a method called `dequeue` that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node's value.
    - Define a method called `peek` that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.

- Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
- Be sure to follow your languages best practices for naming conventions.

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

## Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:
1. Can successfully push onto a stack
2. Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
3. Can successfully pop off the stack
4. Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
5. Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
6. Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
6. Can successfully enqueue into a queue
7. Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
8. Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
9. Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
9. Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
10. Can successfully instantiate an empty queue

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
